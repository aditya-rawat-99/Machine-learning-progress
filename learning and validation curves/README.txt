In this notebook I have made the learning and validation curves of logistic regression and support vector machines.
For Logistic regression I have made the validation curve of only parameter C.
But for SVM both gamma and C has been used.


Note: I have used the location of the dataset that is present on my system. But seperate copy of the same dataset has been supplied.
